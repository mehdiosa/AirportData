# AirportData

### Note
For simplicity purposes data from [Aviationstack's Flight Data API](https://aviationstack.com) is read and stored in `.json` files. This allows for the implementation to work with real API output while not directly accessing the API as it was not possible to implement the functionality without exposing the API key (either in Code or Network activity).
